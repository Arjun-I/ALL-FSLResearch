      <description>I have completed the full Mathematics of Machine Learning specialization on Coursera offered by the Imperial College of London, which involves Linear Algebra, Multivariate Calculus, and Principal Component Analysis.
I have also completed the Machine Learning A-Z™: Hands-On Python &amp;amp; R In Data Science course on Udemy, specifically the Python portion of this course.
In addition to this coursework, I have also have knowledge regarding neural network architecture, specifically deep autoencoders, from my past research.</description>

      <description>The traditional classification by eye is extremely prone to human error due to the simple number of factors that affect a person’s perception, decision making, and thought process. It is also extremely time consuming and expensive as the pathologist would have to spend a great amount of time looking for the individual defining characteristics in the many different morphological variations of the cancerous and healthy cells. This can lead to a greater chance of misdiagnosis and worsening of the patient&amp;rsquo;s condition.</description>

      <title>Traditional Classification of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL)</title>

      <description>Defining characteristics of ALL and healthy cells look extremely similar as seen above.   ALL is caused by genetic mutations that tell the cells to continue growing and dividing instead of following the standard process. It causes rapid creation of immature white blood cells (lymphoblasts) inside the bone marrow instead of mature white blood cells (lymphocytes). There are two types of acute lymphoblastic leukemia: B-lymphoblastic leukemia and T-lymphoblastic leukemia.</description>
